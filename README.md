# MATLAB-Simulink-Simulations
The Repository consists of all my work that corresponds to Simulating using MATLAB Simulink.
UAES Project: It consists of MATLAB Models of Heating using Heatpump, Heating using Boiler, satisfying the Space heating and Domestic water requirements, simulating the whole Building and also the Photovoltaic setup along with the Electic vehicle Charging.
HIWI Work: It consists of my MATLAB Simulink Model, that simulates shared Mobility charging solution optimized to prioritize Photovoltaic power over grid power.
Thesis: This is the model that uses Reinforcement Learning to perform the task in the HIWI work mentioned above, but minimizing our effort in logic development and further development of systems like this by using Machine learning.
